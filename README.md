NeuroGenius - Open source, MRI imaging hardware and software (Using readily-accessible parts and operating systems, all published and documented.)

Our goal: Increasing the oligodendrocyte cell population and performi targeted remyelination through real-time functional MRI analysis for neurofeedback. Primarily as a treatment to restore functionality 
in multiple sclerosis patients and patients with other neurodegenerative diseases.

Primary Endpoints:

    1.) Providing real-time fMRI analysis using fully reproducable open source hardware and software.
    2.) Stimulated Oligodendrocyte cell population growth through secondary neurofeedback stimulation.
    3.) Successful remyeliniation on patients which can be witnessed in professional gadolinium-enhanced MRI imaging, which is universally reproducable.
    
Secondary Endpoints:

    1.) Decreased levels of cNfL levels in blood tests.
    2.) Increased evidence of oligodendrocyte stimulation in blood testing should be conducive to a strong remylenation environment.

<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>NeuroGenius is built entirely using open-source designs, including the OSI² ONE MR imager and the Homemade Liquid Nitrogen Generator.</p>
<p>Original MR Imaging design by OpenSourceImaging.org's OSI² ONE (https://www.opensourceimaging.org/2023/01/09/first-open-source-mri-scanner-presented-the-osii-one/), and is based off of their hardware designs for MRI imaging. Upgrades to their design are underway, and will be posted as they become available. For the moment, it gives us the ability to perform real-time MRI analysis, albeit somewhat low quality. Our goal is to build the technology from this point, and provide detailed documentation on how to build the MRI machine, operate the hardware and software, and build your own projects on top of it.</p>
