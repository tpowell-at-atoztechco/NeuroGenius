Mounting torque 0.75Nm heatsink etc.  //  power supply strips 1Nm // Elco's 1.2Nm
Use brass screws for the power strips to reduce the contact resistance

back panel screws M2.5 x 10  with Schroff 21100464
front panel screws Schroff 21100464 + 21101101
bottom to rods M3 x 6 cheese
bottom to 3D printed ferrite holder M3 x 10 sunk and M3 nuts in the printed parts
bottom to relays M3 x 10 sunk
bottom to heatsink M3 x 6 sunk
bottom to capacitor holders M3 x 10 sunk
PCB to power strips M4 x 8 inbus. Use 2mm aluminium spacer rings on the bushings
PCB to capacitor (2x) M5 x 10 philips

power strip to power strip M4 x 8
PCB to plastic spacer on heatsink M3 x 6 cheese use plastic washer on top of PCB for insulation
GND bracket to GND strip and side panel M4 x 8
GND plate to capacitor M5 x 10
DC in connector M3 x 12 black

thermalgrease should not create a conducting path between the heatspreader plate and the heatsink
use thermal grease between the NTCs and the FET package for thermal contact

The Gradient Filter can be mounted on the back of the amplifier on the 12mm standoffs that connect
the GND of the PCB to the enclosure. Solid copper wires can be used to connect P1,3,5 to the
X, Y and Z outputs of the amplifier.
