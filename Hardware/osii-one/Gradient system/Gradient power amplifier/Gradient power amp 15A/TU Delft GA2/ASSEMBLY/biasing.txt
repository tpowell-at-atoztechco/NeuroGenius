Testing and biasing

First time power up
- Leave the metal cover off the enclosure
- Disconnect all outputs
- Connect a symmetrical power supply of + and -12V and limit the current to 5A
- Attach oscilloscope probes to the power supply to measure the ramping up of the voltage
- Switch on the amplifier. 
- Both supply voltages should ramp up in about 1 second and the fan should start.
- Enable the amplifier with the push button and check for excessive supply current (<5A)


Biasing
- Connect a single gradient coil to the output of channel X
- Turn the potentiometers anti clockwise until the current doesn't drop anymore and notice the current consumption of both power supplies. This is
  at about 0.5A @ + and -13.0V. The potentiometers screws align nicely with the square holes of the metal strip above them.
- The two potentiometers labeled P and N increase the Vgs of the P and N MOSFETs. Clockwise rotation increases the current.
- Increase one of the potentiometers until the current from the powersupply starts to increase
- Do the same with the other potentiometer
- Turning the left potentiometer CW has the same effect on the offset as turning the right on CCW. Use this to set both the offset and bias current.
- Measure the output voltage of the channel X current monitor or with a multimeter and balance the potentiometers such that the output current
  is nulled and the supply currents increase by 0.2A relative to the start value. This should be done after the amplifier has warmed up for 5 min.
- An even better way that makes use of an oscilloscope and a function generator is described in chapter 10.2.1 of the GA_DesignDoc.pdf  
- Repeat for Y and Z with extra coils.



lower one of the supply voltages at a time to test the Under Voltage Lock Out at 10.4V

Check that the gain is about 15A/V
