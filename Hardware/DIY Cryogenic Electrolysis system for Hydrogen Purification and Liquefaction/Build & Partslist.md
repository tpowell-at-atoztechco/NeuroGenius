<h1>Build a Cryogenic Electrolysis system for Hydrogen Purification and Liquefaction</h1>
<p>Follow this guide to create an efficient liquid hydrogen generator! (Based on the <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Homemade-liquid-nitrogen-generator/">Instructable</a> by Imsmooth.)</p>
<h2>Parts list:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Appropriate container</b>: Use an appropriate container to efficiently store your freshly harvested liquid nitrogen. A simple stainless steel vacuum bottle will suffice, although more specialized containers like the Thermo Scientific Thermo-Flaskâ„¢ Benchtop Liquid Nitrogen Containers exist and can be simply modified to contain freshly-extracted liquid nitrogen.</p><p>Storing liquid nitrogen at artificially higher atmospheric pressure can simplify the storage process and increase its stability. By maintaining a higher pressure, such as in a pressurized container, the boiling point of liquid nitrogen can be elevated, allowing it to remain in its liquid state for longer periods. This can facilitate easier handling, reduce the rate of evaporation, and minimize the need for frequent replenishment. However, it is crucial to ensure proper safety measures are in place when working with pressurized containers to prevent any potential hazards.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Compressor (Suggested RIX oil-free SA-3E)</b>: This is the most expensive component. We're using a RIX oil-free SA-3E. This delivers 3 SCFM @ 3500psi (230 ATM). I modified the motor and pulleys to deliver 4 SCFM. A higher flow gives you a faster cool-down and production rate. The high pressure allows you to have a larger temperature drop when you throttle the gas to a lower pressure. You can use a regular refrigerator compressor, but you will be waiting a long time to drop 400 degrees Fahrenheit from the ambient temperature to -320F if you only have 40 ATM of pressure.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Scrubber</b>: You can make this components out of PVC pipe. We used 4" PCV, along with multiple layers of filters and screens. You need to get the correct fittings to get to a pipe size that you can then attach to your compressor. The scrubber uses a material called zeolite, or molecular sieve. We specifically used 13x molecular sieve and added some 4A sieve material that had a color indicator added so I know when it has reached saturation. You determine the size of the scrubber based on your flow rate. If you want 3-4 SCFM then you need about 10-15lbs of the material and size the scrubber based on this.</p><p>Purchase links:</p>

<li><p><b>Zeolite</b>: Naturally occurring or man-made, with finely porous material with holes that are angstroms in size and bind with CO2 and water, which enter and bind with the pores, letting the other gases, like O2 and N2 pass through. The color-indicator will change from light blue to gray when the material can not adsorb any more water. The material is regenerated by heating to 350F, driving off the CO2 and water.

<li><p><b>200-micron screening</b>: Used to seperate different levels of zeolite for improved filteration. This screening holds the 10 lbs of material in place and prevents it from getting sucked into the compressor, but still allows for air-flow.
