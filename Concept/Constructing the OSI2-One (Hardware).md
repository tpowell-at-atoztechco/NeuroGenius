<h1>Constructing the OSI<sup>2</sup> One MRI Imager</h1>

<h2>Current Methology</h2>

While the designs are all here, it is important to know how the components all go together to form an open-source MRI machine. Furthermore, it is important to know how to test and optimize your build for further development.

<h2>Parts List</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>30cm Halbach Magnet</b>:  Used to generate a strong and uniform magnetic field to facilitate the imaging process by manipulating the alignment of hydrogen nuclei.<p>Description: This part needs to be 3D Printed or CNC'd to exact specifications, incorporating over 4,000 permanent magnets (~4000x (12x12x12)mmÂ³ NdFeB magnets in Halbach arrangement!</p></li>
<li><b>Solenoid d205mm N20 3seg</b>: generate a focused and uniform RF magnetic field in the region of interest, ensuring efficient excitation and detection of the signals from the targeted area. <p>Description: This part needs to be 3D printed or CNC'd to exact specifications. The magnetic field is both created by and read back using this coil.</p></li>
